#Multithreaded Client Server App

Run the code by simply running the Main class. Upon running the class, the following steps will occur:

A new instance of the MultiThreadedServer class will be created and passed a port number as an argument.

A new thread will be created and the MultiThreadedServer instance will be passed to this thread as a runnable object.

The new thread will start executing the run method of the MultiThreadedServer class.

Unfortunately upon sending a GET request via Postman to http://localhost:8080. It does not get a response, as you will see in the video. you can tell me what I'm doing wrong.
